Sales Analysis and Prediction

Analyzed historical sales data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and developed a Linear Regression model to forecast future sales based on factors like units sold, costs, profits, 
and discounts. Conducted exploratory data analysis, including trend analysis and correlation studies. Achieved near-perfect model fit with minimal Mean Squared Error (MSE) and 
R-squared value of 1.0. Further enhanced insights through interactive visualizations and dashboards using Power BI, enabling effective decision-making and strategic planning.
